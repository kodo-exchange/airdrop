## Eligibility

The following groups are eligible to receive the airdrop:

- **Kodo Testnet Users** (20M, 5%): These early supporters and active participants have played a crucial role in bootstrapping the Kodo community.
- **Loopring Community** (40M, 10%): As one of the most knowledgeable DeFi communities, the Loopring community has a fantastic spirit that Kodo will strive to emulate. We anticipate a strong synergy between Kodo and Loopring moving forward, and we are grateful for their support.

## Scoring Rules

For Kodo testnet users, we have taken into account all interactions with our protocol, as well as Galxe leaderboard scores, which reflect the users' active participation and contributions.

For Loopring community members, we have used the same rules as Loopring's `TAIKO` airdrop ([criteria](https://loopring.io/#/document/TAIKO_Airdrop_Eligibility_and_Criteria.md)). The amount of `KODO` each address receives will be 16x the amount of `TAIKO` (simply 40M/2.5M = 16).

The scoring rules for the airdrop are detailed in [score.py](./score.py).

## Snapshot

The snapshot for testnet users was captured at Hekla height `213296`, on the eve of the Taiko mainnet launch.

The snapshot for the Loopring community will be updated daily based on their daily `TAIKO` airdrop transactions, as seen on [\[0x4374...2768 | Taikoscan\]](https://taikoscan.io/tokentxns?a=0x4374D3d032B3c96785094ec9f384f07077792768).

Find the details in the [./snapshot](./snapshot/) files.

## Claim Period

The airdrop can be claimed over a period of 4 weeks.

## Future Distribution

If you didn't receive an airdrop, there's no need to worry. We will be distributing 40% of the reserved `KODO` to protocol contributors over the next few months. Please stay tuned for more details.
